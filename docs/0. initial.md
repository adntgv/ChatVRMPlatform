we are building a platform for creating custom 3D Visualized, LLM, TTS, interactive characters
- users should be able to
    - register
    - provide LLM token (open ai for now)
    - create characters:
        - name it
        - select visual model (vrm format) 
            we will have preselected for now as people might upload unacceptable VRMs
        - system prompt
        - select voice
        - make it scripted or agentic:
            - scripted: provide script that is fixed
            - agentic: attach knowledgebase
    - then publish the character
    - monetize their agents

usecases:
    interactive learning tutors
    support agents
    virtual streamers
    etc etc
