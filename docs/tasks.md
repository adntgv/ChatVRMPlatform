## Implementation Notes

### Priority Guidelines
1. **Start with technical debt** - Testing and state management are blocking future development
2. **Quick wins build momentum** - User uploads and voice selection show immediate value
3. **Foundation before features** - Backend infrastructure enables all future development
4. **Iterate on feedback** - Launch beta features early to gather user input

### Technical Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Keep the demo functional throughout development
- Consider serverless for cost-effective scaling initially
- Plan for data migration from localStorage to database

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with monolith, extract services as needed
- Use managed services where possible (Auth0, Stripe)
- Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one
- Create rollback procedures for all deployments
- Maintain clear separation between demo and platform code
