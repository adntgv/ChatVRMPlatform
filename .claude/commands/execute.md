Look at docs/tasks.md, think hard and collect all information that is needed for the next task/subtask, create more subtasks if needed. 
You can use gemini-cli for discussing your ideas and collecting another point of view.
Keep updating of done tasks in the tasks.md 
If task is vague use planning mode and plan how to best implement that task. Add implementation plan as subtasks to tasks.md
Always follow TDD, first write failing tests, then create functionality to pass those tests.
First focus on "business logic" like desired behavior, required models, fields, repositories, services and etc, do the UI implementation last. It should be based on thoroughly tested business logic implementation
For external services that are going to be used, make interfaces with mock implementations and add tasks for proper implementation somewhere suitable in roadmap in tasks.md, unblock yourself now
do not hesitate to consult gemini if it is suitable/applicable/would add value or improve speed with delegation


At the end of execution do some reflection and say what could have been improved in the workflow that we are following
