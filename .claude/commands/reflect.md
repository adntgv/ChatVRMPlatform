### 10. Final Reflection & Continuous Improvement
At task completion:
1. **What worked well?**  
2. **What was challenging?**  
3. **What tools/patterns emerged?** 
4. **What follow-up tasks were discovered?**  

After answering to those questions think hard what kind of information can improve your workflow execute.md, CLAUDE.md or should go as a task to tasks.md
Then go and update those documents only if your findings bring value to those documents
